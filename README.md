# Low-Fidelity-Mockup
This is a low fidelity mockup of a market place for mobile devices. Made to showcase an example of how can a mockup can be.

My design tries to go straight to the point. A main menu in case you don't have an account, a sign in and log in depending if it is your first time with the app, and you are ready to use the market place.
I think is good for a publication to be clickable in any corner, just like the ones of Facebook or X(twitter).
 My inicial concept was to just look and buy with the details and if necesseray contact the owner of the offer. An update of this mockup should add a logout option in the settings and the option to sell products. I would add it in the User profile options or in a bottom corner. For a high fidelity mockup I'd seek for friendly colors like a Sky blue, or any type of color that is friendly for the eye, so it can be used whenever the user would want to use it.
There might be new features in the high fidelity mockup that I didn't of it till this moment, time will just tell.
